	<h2>History of CSS</h2><hr>
	<p>Hakon Wium Lie released the first draft of “Cascading HTML Style Sheets” in October 1994. Although it took 3 years for any browser to come close to fully implementing CSS, August 1996 Microsoft Internet Explorer became the first browser to support CSS.
		<ul>
			<li>The CSS 1 W3C Recommendation was made in December 1996.</li>
			<li>In May of 1998, the W3C released CSS 2 which added new capabilities including z-index, media types, bidirectional text, absolute, relative and fixed positioning, and support for aural style sheets.</li>
			<li>With the release of CSS 3, capabilities were broken into modules. Between June 2011 and June 2012, the following four modules were released as formal recommendations: color, selectors level 3, namespaces and media queries.</li>
